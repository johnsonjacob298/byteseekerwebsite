<p>This is my personal project, made from ChatGPT, w3schools.com, and trial and error.
    If you want to fork it, do as you may.
    Just note that there may be issues that arent listed because of 
    this being a personal project.</p>

<p>7/20/25 - this project has been moved to a self-hosting platform on a raspberry pi.

Please reference to that to see this project, and https://byteseeker.cc for the current, always up
to date project. This project will now no longer be updated.</p>
