    <h2>About Jacob</h2>
    <hr>
      <br>
    <p>Hi! My name is Jacob. I like all kinds of technology, it's my hobby after all. My birthday is March 4th, and I'm currently 18 years old. I work at an autoparts store, in Indiana. I was born and rasied in Indiana,
    but I'm not going to say what city for privacy reasons. I am a child of God, but I struggle with a lot too, but doesn't everyone. I don't talk to many people, so if I don't know you, you might have to come up to me to
    get my attention. I am very introverted, I have ADHD, autism, and some others I'd rather not say.
    <br><br>
    I'm not good at bios, so this is probably cringe. Deal with it.</p>
